    "and people wonder why the world is fucked",
    "couldn't give a flying fuck about that",

    "IKR, the world's gone mad",
    "gonna be interesting to see what happens, will the bitching and retaliations keep going, will anyone else get involved, who knows, i think we currently have the most volatile people in leadership in modern history, so really anything could fuckin happen",
    "if it turns out that they really did just murder a whole jet full of civilians on purpose, i'd say that should make whether or not Trump \"shooting first\" is bad or not irrelevant.",
    "Exactly, it makes no sense for it to be an accident, which begs the question of why did they do that",
    "eh, considering how the iran government runs the country, i dont think they care about some sacrificed civilians and what people think of it, i mean they routinely hang people just for being gay, and the entire world saying \"hey thats evil, can you dont\" hasnt stopped them yet",
    "ILike I just have no idea how tf they could mess up that badly.",
    "Well, maybe a \"mistake\" in the sense that they thought it _wasn't_ a civ passenger jet, or that...... IDK, it got hijacked by an enemy.",
    "Ironically that kinda makes me wonder if it was accidental because of how outlandish it would be for them to just randomly deliberately shoot a civ aircraft.. But yeah couldn't have been a mistake IMO",
    "especially cause also, if civilian flights go through that area, that means that it's an active flight path, so they'd *know* commercial flights go through there, an airport is needed nd its not like they only have one plane that visits every few years, it's gonna be an active flight path that's used regularly, they should have known it was civilians just based on where it was",
    "They accidentally targetted, accidentally authorized to shoot, accidentally locked, and accidentally pressed fire...",
    "Missile*, it's not like you just press one button with a slipped finger.",
    "I don't buy it whatever they though they saw anyway, you don't just \"accidentally\" fire an AA missle",
    "civilian jets are long and and cylindrical, so kind of like a missile, maybe they misjudged the size and thought it was a guided missile.",
    "i mean, i dont even think it *was* an accident, im more inclined to believe that the blaming on america strategy was the plan all along, cause it as veeeery convenient timing, but i guess it backfired when people looked in to it, as people do",
    "a military jet that is",
    "I don't think mistaking it for a jet would be likely because those would be made to be invisible on radar and would give a totally different shape of signal if detected at all.",
    "My guess is they mistook the radar signal for a US missile or maybe a jet..",
    "IKR, somethin aint't right there",
    "yeah i been hearing a bit about the plane crash",
    "they shot the plane down, denied it happened, blamed it on america and then finally after awhile admitted they did it \"unintentionally\"",

    "Yeah. The 53 coup screwed them over",
    "It doesn't surprise me that they hate us",
    "I mean ffs the CIA and SAS assassinated their democratically elected leader Mossadeq and installed a tyrant. There are tyrants all over we've installed we don't say boo about so long as they hold our interests at heart",
    "Breh, the way I see it, Iran has been fucked with by the US for 60 years and has been geopolitically backed into a corner. It's a similar situation with North Korea. They're not saints, they repress their minorities (or in NK's case their everybody). But they are trying to form an independent Middle East alliance outside the influence of the West.",
    "The US acts tough to beat down Iran from the historical 50 year clusterfuck they got into, to Iran wanting to fan the flames of US bad, knowing that Trump is their trump card.",
    "Bruh i didnt say that iran is the aggressor in that statement.",
    "But both the US and Iran are taking swings to gain some global reputation here and there. They are starting shit at the expense of the peace we have here.",
    "Not that I think they really call the shots",
    "Actually, it really isnt Trump, this honestly would have been done by anyone who was sitting president right now.",
    "Luckily it looks like it's already over. Another publicity stunt by Trump to get reelected probably. Iran can't really do shit, they would get raped even if they got some backing by Russia.",
    "Can't really have it both ways, if a war over some bullshit starts it's the fault of whoever lit the match. And yea, U.S. has no business being there in the first place",

    "This is another either or political dilemma. People are stupid.",
    "Everyone is terrible in this stupid conflict. Its either orange man super bad or bomb terrorist good.",
    "A lot of the reason for the controversy is the information some people have points to his assassination being a unilateral move out of the blue",
    "Can you share some sources on this",
    "He also supported multiple other terrorist organisations, also has been attacking US facilities, embassies, seized and attacked ships",
    "Just because two terrorist groups fight each other doesn't make one the good guys",
    "The assassination wasn't an ignition, it was retaliation",
    "He was backing the Kurds against ISIL but I guess that makes him a terrorist.",

    "we combat terrorism in the UK by lighting candles and singing",
    "<@!473027579863891968> If you're saying that I shouldn't talk about politics, try prooving your point by making a call with me",
    "The claims that Iran has \"proxy interests\" backing ISIL are as specious as the claims that Turkey helped Caliphate forces occupy oil feilds to buy their reserves at cheaper prices. We don't really know what's going on in the Middle East because every side has mercenaries. ",
    "We're on the brink of WWIII not because of Soleimani but because of his assassination. Keep that in mind. If Trump was serious about his statement that killing a general of another nation's army was supposed to somehow \"prevent a war\" then he'll stop there. This recent Iranian retaliation just killed a bunch of Iraqi troops in a U.S. base, kids that don't have anything else to do to survive there. A strong indication of what this war would be, a huge mess involving UAE, Israel, Russia, US, and China, God knows who else, sending a bunch of pawns to slaughter each other over a bunch of politicians trying to save face.",
    "U.S. interest in Iraq have never been about stabilizing the Sunny Shia conflict or actually helping Kurd autonomy. If that were so we would be demanding things diplomatically under Obama from Assad and Ahmanijad to stop backing their own respective sides of the civil war against each other and focus on ISIL. Stop running guns through Raqqa and  have the U.N. force Syria and Iraq to acknowledge Kurdistan.",
    "But the idea that the U.S. is there trying to stabilize the region is ridiculous considering ISIL existence is a direct result of U.S. occupation and interventionism for the purpose of destabilizing Saddam and securing the oil fields in Amarah and the Golen Heights as well as be an imperial backing presence for the Saudis and Israel.",
    "What Trump admin did was an act of war. You don't make strategic strikes on high military officials of other states unilaterally unless you're at war.",
    "There's no use anymore pointing out how one side is hypocritical and the other isn't. They're both the same taking turns with bullshit talking points like when the Blue team criticized Trump admin for withdrawing U.S. forces from Iraq saying we were abandoning the Kurds etc.",
    "Maybe you shouldn't talk politics",

Like I'd prob be more concerned about animal or environmental exploitation than human labour, cause my first thought when buying stuff isn't if it was made for cheap in China, but what I can do with the product. I can see why that's pretty bad because, not buying something if you found out it was made using cheap labour would mean you have less options of where to buy the same kind of product, and the other companies that make similar products probably aren't much better.. but that takes time and emotional reasoning!! i don't wanna think damn it :PP",

The owner of the means of production is in a position to purchase the labor power of the worker.

    "`I have now reached the point where I may indicate briefly what to me constitutes the essence of the crisis of our time. It concerns the relationship of the individual to society. The individual has become more conscious than ever of his dependence upon society. But he does not experience this dependence as a positive asset, as an organic tie, as a protective force, but rather as a threat to his natural rights, or even to his economic existence. Moreover, his position in society is such that the egotistical drives of his make-up are constantly being accentuated, while his social drives, which are by nature weaker, progressively deteriorate. All human beings, whatever their position in society, are suffering from this process of deterioration. Unknowingly prisoners of their own egotism, they feel insecure, lonely, and deprived of the naive, simple, and unsophisticated enjoyment of life. Man can find meaning in life, short and perilous as it is, only through devoting himself to society.`",

Is the death penalty murder? Is shooting deserters, traitors, murderers, or rapists within your own ranks murder? If you answer yes to any of these, you may call Guevara a murderer. If you answer no, I would argue that there is no evidence to accuse Guevara of murder.",

Less time means compact media is more efficient to deliver information vs older sources. This accelerates with extra short form media on the internet, and when political bias snowballs and internet media becomes riddled with people mining for brownie points (at the cost of truth, I'd reference specifically), it becomes extremely easy to lock people into a narrow band of information, which then becomes a narrow band of ideas and understanding of ideas. I'm not gonna act high and mighty, but I've made a point (out of curiosity and being puzzled) of picking people's brains for what their beliefs are and why.

    "in fmod one doesnt have to do that, but can write plugin-ish things if one desires to do that...",
    "but it typically just breaks down to having a really additional complexity involved with that, probably most code in alaudio is just dealing with variousf ile formats",

    "openal is really terrible",

    "but in like unreal when you hit like the first vent shaft, alaudio sounds completely wrong, and actually in that spot pretty horrible",
    "in like nyc street",
    "thats in particular noticable when you try movement wrt some ambient sound",

In a way that's GMDX fault, a lot got broken in DX that worked.",

    "we tested dynamicupdaterate on 120",
    "we tested 20 which is default",

    "dynamic is for bullets shots",
    "Neither of them seem to have any visible change though.",

    "those arent settings in ut99",
    "does anyone know what StaticUpdateRate=12",
    "Yeah no worries, I wonder wtf is causing staggered movement there..",
    "60 tick is also fine for dx, so dunno what else could be a problem, outside of plain high ping lag, or packet losss.",
    "ill report back if i find if a setting works",

    "the clients movement are all jerky and laggy",
    "not sure whats up with it on deus ex",
    "i use 35 on ut99",
    "see if that will make that go away",
    "and im going to try tick rate of 60",
    "i upped it to 40000",

    "I can't remember what videos I watched exactly though, but it's something I just about remember.",
    "Ah yeah that works for roguelikes with rooms and doors, what I was remembering though was random terrain generation, it makes new terrain in the direction that you move but takes what you can currently see into account so that new tiles of high elevation or water are generated in locations that make sense. But making sure that area doesn't get borked after unloading it and then moving back might be annoying.",
    "yeah, thats the tricky part",
    "essentially you need to come up with a system where you generate a pool of things the floor needs, THEN you throw in extra rooms/items/etc, then you need to connect them all up and make sure all connections *work* (my DXMP roguelike failed at that part) and make sure all the important parts actually get connected, whic usually means some repeat loops of making sure the generation doesnt stop until everythings connected, and then having a catch to stop that infinite looping if theres no valid connections available",
    "Oh yeah and making sure that the level can be beaten, even FPS games get that wrong; one of the expansion packs to Shadow Warrior was borked.. the final boss only appears in the two hardest difficulties because of a bug or something.",
    "thaaat part isnt so hard, its just standard memory",
    "as long as your system remembers that it exists and doesnt de-reference or garbage cleanup that sector, and in roguelike terms, as long as its still connected to the same doors, that all is the same",
    "and generally, roguelikes generate the entire \"floor\" at once, and saves that to the current runtime memory, and the players just moving along stuff that already exists,, so nothing'll ever get re-written unless you tell it to, essentially, it's just moving through rooms, and after each floor transition, the old floor is forgotten and the new ones generated",
    "Funnily enough randomly generating stuff I haven't tried yet. But i've seen ppl make procedurally generated worlds, and you've gotta like ensure that when a bit of the world that you just unloaded after moving away from will be the same as it was before, and not just overwritten with a new random room because you unloaded it and then moved back.. IDK how tf it works tbh.",
